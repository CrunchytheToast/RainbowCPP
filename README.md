A simple demonstration of the graphics capabilities of the classic C/C++ IDE for DOS, Turbo C++.
The source code is in the file "RAINBOW.CPP" in this repo and is free under the GNU GPL v3 license.

While a stepping stone, my long-term goal is to remake these animations, if applicable, in a modern programming language, such as Python. That way, anyone can try and tinker with my programs without the need to scour the internet for copies of legacy IDEs.

Thank you!
